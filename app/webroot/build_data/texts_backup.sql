(8, 'About', '    <h1>About Atlas of Urban Expansion</h1><br>\r\n    <p>The NYU Urban Expansion Program at the Marron Institute of Urban\r\n    Management and the Stern School of Business of New York University, in\r\n    partnership with UN-Habitat and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, has\r\n    initiated a multi-phase research effort to monitor the quantitative and\r\n    qualitative aspects of global urban expansion. This effort is a\r\n    continuation of an earlier project by the authors and their colleagues that\r\n    resulted in the Atlas of Urban Expansion (Cambridge MA: Lincoln Institute\r\n    of Land Policy, 2012). The monitoring program has now completed the data\r\n    collection and has begun the interpretation and analysis of the data in\r\n    three interdependent phases in a global representative sample of 200\r\n    cities:</p><br>\r\n    <h2>Phase I</h2>\r\n    <p>The Mapping &amp; Measurement of Global Urban\r\n    Expansion—focused on the mapping and measurement of several key attributes\r\n    of global urban expansion—the overall urban extent of cities, the average\r\n    population density of that extent, the fragmentation of the built-up area\r\n    within it by open spaces, the compactness of its overall geographic shape,\r\n    and the shares of infill, extension, leapfrog, and inclusion in the added\r\n    built-up areas within new urban extents—in three time periods: Circa 1990,\r\n    circa 2000, and circa 2014. This phase required the classification and\r\n    analysis of medium-resolution Landsat satellite imagery as well as census\r\n    data associated with enumeration zones that contained the urban extents of\r\n    these cities.</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <h2>Phase II</h2>\r\n    <p>The Mapping and Measurement of Urban Layouts—focused on\r\n    two key questions: How well laid out were recently-built urban peripheries\r\n    (areas built between 1990 and 2014) in comparison to urban areas built\r\n    before 1990 in the global sample of cities? and how well laid out were city\r\n    areas built in five different time periods—before 1900, between 1900 and\r\n    1930, between 1930 and 1960, between 1960 and 1990, and between 1990 and\r\n    2014—in a representative sample of 30 cities. This phase required\r\n    digitizing and analyzing high-resolution Bing and Google Earth imagery.</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <h2>Phase III</h2>\r\n    <p>The Land and Housing Survey in a Global Sample of\r\n    Cities—included two separate surveys. The first, a Survey of the Regulatory\r\n    Regime Governing Land and Housing, sought to capture land ownership\r\n    patterns, land-use planning practices, and the development of new\r\n    subdivisions in expansion areas of cities. The second, the Affordability\r\n    Survey, sought to measure the prices as well as the key attributes of\r\n    different types of residential plots, houses, and apartments available for\r\n    sale or rent in the 200 cities in the global sample and to compare them\r\n    with household incomes in these cities. This phase requires the engagement\r\n    of City-Based Researchers in these cities as well as Regional Coordinators\r\n    based at NYU.</p>\r\n    <p></p>\r\n    <p></p>\r\n    <h1>Urban Expansion Team</h1>\r\n    <p></p>\r\n    <p><img src="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/About/Solly_300px.jpg" style="width: 300px;"><br></p>\r\n    <h4>Shlomo (Solly)Angel</h4>\r\n    <p>Shlomo (Solly) Angel is a Professor of\r\n    City Planning at the Marron Institute of Urban Management and a Senior\r\n    Research Scholar at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

Their contributions to the study of urban expansion over numerous years deserve lasting acknowledgment.</p><p>An earlier study in 2004–2005 leading to the creation of this new edition of the Atlas involved the collection and analysis of satellite imagery and census data in the global sample of 120 cities. It was supported by a grant from the Research Committee of the World Bank to the Transport and Urban Development Department of the Bank and resulted in a publication titled The Dynamics of Global Urban Expansion (Angel, et al., 2005). We are grateful to Christine Kessides of the department for helping us obtain this grant. We are also grateful to Deborah Balk of the Center for International Earth Sciences Information Network (CIESIN) of Columbia University for providing the census maps and data for the sample of cities. The team that worked on this phase of the study included Shlomo Angel, Stephen Sheppard, and Daniel Civco as principal investigators, assisted by Jason Parent, Anna Chabaeva, Micah Perlin, Lucy Gitlin, and Robert Buckley.</p><p>This earlier study of the sample of 120 cities continued with a second set of studies in 2009–2012 involving the creation of a set of metrics for measuring urban spatial structure and a python script for calculating these metrics with ArcGIS software. These studies included the collection, geo-referencing, and digitizing of maps at 20–25 year intervals for the 1800–2000 period for a representative sample of 30 cities; the statistical modeling of the results of all the phases; the preparation of several working papers as well as papers in peer-reviewed journals; the drafting of the Lincoln Institute’s Policy Focus Report titled Making Room for a Planet of Cities (Angel, S. et al., 2011); and the preparation and publication of two companion volumes: the Atlas of Urban Expansion (Angel, S. et al., 2012) and Planet of Cities (Angel, S. 2012). Work on these studies was undertaken by Shlomo Angel, Jason Parent, Daniel Civco, and Alejandro Blei. All work on these studies benefited from the generous support of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the direct assistance of Gregory K.

Different countries have adopted different thresholds for a human settlement to be considered a ‘city’, but there is near universal agreement that a settlement of 100,000 people or more constitutes a city. We also focus our attention not on single municipalities but on entire metropolitan areas: contiguous urban areas that may contain many municipalities are considered to be a single city.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br>We define cities by the extent of their built-up area, rather than by their administrative or its jurisdictional boundaries. The extrema tectorum—the limit of the built-up area of the city, as it was referred to in Ancient Rome—defines the city, and the city thus defined is our unit of analysis. We have now identified 4,245 cities on our planet that were homes to 100,000 people or more in 2010. These 4,245 cities constitute our Universe of Cities with a total population amounted to 2.5 billion, or 70 percent of the world’s 2010 urban population of 3.6 billion.</p>\r\n	<p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 18px;"><br></span></p>\r\n	<h4><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 18px;">Atlas of Urban Expansion 2016 edition</span></h4>\r\n	<p><a download="" href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Full Volumes/Atlas of Urban Expansion 2016 Volume 1 - Areas and Densities.pdf?time=1476445777143">Volume 1: Areas and Densities 649 Mb<br></a><a download="" href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Full Volumes/Atlas of Urban Expansion 2016 Volume 2 - Blocks and Roads.pdf?time=1476445725960">Volume 2: Blocks and Roads 932 Mb</a></p>\r\n	<h4>Methodology</h4>\r\n	<p><a href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Methodology/The_Global_Sample_of_Cities.pdf?time=1476446504182">PDF</a>&nbsp;The Global Sample of Cities\r\n		<br><a href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Methodology/Understanding_and_Measuring_Urban_Expansion.pdf?time=1476446554646">PDF</a>&nbsp;Understanding and Measuring Urban Expansion\r\n		<br><a href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Methodology/Understanding_and_Measuring_Urban_Layouts.pdf?time=1476446569669" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">PDF</a>&nbsp;Understanding and Measuring Urban Layouts</p>\r\n		<h4><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 18px;">Tables</span></h4>\r\n		<p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit;"><a download="" href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Areas_and_Densities_Tables/Areas_and_Densities_Table_1.csv?time=1476445928498">CSV</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span><a href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Areas_and_Densities_Tables/Areas_and_Densities_Table_1.xlsx?time=1476445970255">XLSX</a>&nbsp;<span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit;">Areas and Densities&nbsp;<br></span><a download="" href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Blocks_and_Roads_Tables/Blocks_and_Roads_Table_1.csv?time=1476446017157" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); outline: 0px;">CSV</a>\r\n			<font color="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;</font>|\r\n			<font color="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;</font><a href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Blocks_and_Roads_Tables/Blocks_and_Roads_Table_1.xlsx?time=1476446050567">XLSX</a>&nbsp;Blocks and Roads\r\n			<br><a download="" href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Blocks_and_Roads_Tables/Blocks_and_Roads_Table_2.csv?time=1476446170646" style="outline: 0px;">CSV</a>\r\n			<font color="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;</font>|\r\n			<font color="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;</font><a href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/file-manager/userfiles/data_page/Blocks_and_Roads_Tables/Blocks_and_Roads_Table_2.xlsx?time=1476446193604">XLSX</a>&nbsp;<span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit;">Historical Data for Blocks and Roads</span></p>\r\n			<p></p>\r\n			<p></p>\r\n', 'data', 'page', '2016-09-23 14:30:55'),

Their contributions to the study of urban expansion over numerous years deserve lasting acknowledgment.</p><p>An earlier study in 2004–2005 leading to the creation of this new edition of the Atlas involved the collection and analysis of satellite imagery and census data in the global sample of 120 cities. It was supported by a grant from the Research Committee of the World Bank to the Transport and Urban Development Department of the Bank and resulted in a publication titled The Dynamics of Global Urban Expansion (Angel, et al., 2005). We are grateful to Christine Kessides of the department for helping us obtain this grant. We are also grateful to Deborah Balk of the Center for International Earth Sciences Information Network (CIESIN) of Columbia University for providing the census maps and data for the sample of cities. The team that worked on this phase of the study included Shlomo Angel, Stephen Sheppard, and Daniel Civco as principal investigators, assisted by Jason Parent, Anna Chabaeva, Micah Perlin, Lucy Gitlin, and Robert Buckley.</p><p>This earlier study of the sample of 120 cities continued with a second set of studies in 2009–2012 involving the creation of a set of metrics for measuring urban spatial structure and a python script for calculating these metrics with ArcGIS software. These studies included the collection, geo-referencing, and digitizing of maps at 20–25 year intervals for the 1800–2000 period for a representative sample of 30 cities; the statistical modeling of the results of all the phases; the preparation of several working papers as well as papers in peer-reviewed journals; the drafting of the Lincoln Institute’s Policy Focus Report titled Making Room for a Planet of Cities (Angel, S. et al., 2011); and the preparation and publication of two companion volumes: the Atlas of Urban Expansion (Angel, S. et al., 2012) and Planet of Cities (Angel, S. 2012). Work on these studies was undertaken by Shlomo Angel, Jason Parent, Daniel Civco, and Alejandro Blei. All work on these studies benefited from the generous support of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the direct assistance of Gregory K. Ingram, its president, and Ann LeRoyer, its director of publications at the time.</p><p>The Atlas of Urban Expansion—2016 Edition was undertaken by a partnership of three institutions, the NYU Urban Expansion Program at the Marron Institute of Urban Management and the Stern School of Business of New York University, The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.
